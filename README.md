# gs-dotfiles
My configuration scripts for newly installed systems, adapted from several sources:

https://github.com/Juxtaposedwords/dotfiles  
https://github.com/twolfson/sexy-bash-prompt  
https://github.com/mrzool/bash-sensible  
https://github.com/amix/vimrc (basic version)  

NOTE: This is still a work in progress.  Some things need to be deprecated, removed, modified, and added.  Use at your own risk.
